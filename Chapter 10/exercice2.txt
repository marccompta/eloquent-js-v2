# Copied from the book:

Here is what I came up with. I’ve put parentheses around internal functions.

Module "grid"
  Vector
  Grid
  directions
  directionNames

Module "world"
  (randomElement)
  (elementFromChar)
  (charFromElement)
  View
  World
  LifelikeWorld
  directions [reexported]

Module "simple_ecosystem"
  (randomElement) [duplicated]
  (dirPlus)
  Wall
  BouncingCritter
  WallFollower

Module "ecosystem"
  Wall [duplicated]
  Plant
  PlantEater
  SmartPlantEater
  Tiger
I have reexported the directions array from the grid module from world so that modules built on that (the ecosystems) don’t have to know or worry about the existence of the grid module.

I also duplicated two generic and tiny helper values (randomElement and Wall) since they are used as internal details in different contexts and do not belong in the interfaces for these modules.
